I'm not sure *what* I'm going to use this blog for, but I desperately want to get back into the blogging game. I miss having a voice on the internet. I haven't had an actual blog since I was a teenager (tumblr does not count), so, almost a decade ago.

Anyhoo, my name is Hannah. I'm a twenty seven year old woman, working in retail management (oh how glamorous), trying to go back to school for physics and astronomy. Once again stuck living with my parent because I had a piece of trash roommate. God I miss living on my own.

I'm weird and a huge fuckin nerd. I like a lot of weird stuff, eg: math, astrology and Homestuck. I curse freely and probably too much for some peoples taste.

I'm an Aquarius Sun/Aries Moon/Sagittarius Rising combo. Did I mention I love astrology because I love astrology? No no, NOT to predict my future but how the stars and planets alignment affect personality. I'm one of those people who says they don't believe in astrology but I kinda do. In an amusing sort of way. I don't know. Don't judge me.

Other than those things? Well. I'm just me. Twenty seven years old, dog lover, pseudo-vegetarian, huge fuckin nerd, me. Yeah!

Welcome to my precious little life.
